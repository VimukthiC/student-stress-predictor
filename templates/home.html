            It's essential for students to manage stress to maintain their mental and physical well-being. Strategies like time management, seeking support from teachers or counselors, maintaining a healthy lifestyle with adequate sleep, exercise, and nutrition, and practicing mindfulness or relaxation techniques can help cope with stress. Additionally, having a support network of friends and family is crucial in navigating stressful periods.

            Creating a balanced schedule, setting realistic goals, and learning to prioritize tasks can significantly reduce stress levels. If stress becomes overwhelming, seeking professional help is always advisable. Universities often have counseling services or mental health professionals who can provide support and guidance. Taking care of mental health is just as important as academic success.
